        <p>
          An experiment to build a{' '}
          <strong>next-generation SaaS platform</strong> powered by AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows you to get the data your company needs by simply asking for
          it. <strong>No need for individual dashboards</strong> for marketing,
          sales, and other employees.
        </p>
        <p>Everyone has different access rights and requests what they need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing</strong> need data on leads and conversions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sales</strong> need data on customers and their purchases
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finance</strong> need data on revenue and expenses
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>
            AI processes requests and builds the necessary tables and charts on
            the fly
          </strong>
          , without the need to create and maintain dozens of separate reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          This saves time and resources, allowing employees to focus on{' '}
          <em>data analysis and decision-making</em> rather than report
          preparation.
