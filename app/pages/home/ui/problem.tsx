          But GPT knows the answers, what is the problem?

        <p>
          Yes, GPT knows the answers to the questions it has been trained on.
          But your company's data is different.{' '}
          <strong>It wasn't trained on it.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Any company's database exceeds 1,000,000 tokens</strong> -
            GPT cannot read and analyze it in a single request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GPT doesn't have current data</strong> - it was trained on
            something. It takes everything from its memory, not from your
            company's database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GPT has no priorities</strong> - for it, your company's data
            is as important as advice from an internet guru on a forum.
            Therefore, it will often suggest incorrect data.
          </li>
